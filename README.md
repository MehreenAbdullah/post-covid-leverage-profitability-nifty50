Post-covid-leverage-profitability-nifty50

This project examines how Nifty 50 companies adjusted their capital structures after the COVID-19 shock and whether post-pandemic deleveraging translated into improved profitability. Using firm-level data on Debt-to-Equity ratios and net profit (₹ Cr), the analysis measures structural shifts in leverage across pre- and post-COVID periods and evaluates earnings recovery through year-over-year profit growth. The relationship between leverage adjustments and profitability outcomes is assessed using correlation analysis and OLS regression.

The findings indicate that a majority of firms reduced leverage post-COVID, reflecting balance sheet strengthening during the recovery phase. Regression results suggest a statistically significant negative relationship between leverage change and profit performance, implying that firms that deleveraged more aggressively tended to exhibit stronger earnings improvements, although explanatory power remains moderate.
