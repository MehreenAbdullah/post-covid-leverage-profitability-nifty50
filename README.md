Post-covid-leverage-profitability-nifty50

This project examines how Nifty 50 companies adjusted their capital structures after the COVID-19 shock and whether post-pandemic deleveraging translated into improved profitability. Using firm-level data on Debt-to-Equity ratios and net profit (₹ Cr), the analysis measures structural shifts in leverage across pre- and post-COVID periods and evaluates earnings recovery through year-over-year profit growth. The relationship between leverage adjustments and profitability outcomes is assessed using correlation analysis and OLS regression.


Project Structure

* Data cleaning and preparation of firm-level financial data
* Computation of Debt-to-Equity changes and profit growth rates
* Visualization of leverage distribution and earnings trends*
* Correlation and quadrant analysis*
* OLS regression to test statistical significance


Key Findings

* A majority of firms reduced leverage in the post-COVID period, indicating broad balance sheet strengthening.
* Profit growth rebounded after the pandemic shock, though performance varied across firms.
* Regression results show a statistically significant negative relationship between leverage change and profit performance.
* The explanatory power is moderate, suggesting that while deleveraging contributed to earnings recovery, other factors also influenced profitability.


Conclusion

The analysis suggests that post-COVID deleveraging was not merely defensive but aligned with improved earnings outcomes. Firms that strengthened their balance sheets appear to have positioned themselves more effectively for recovery, although capital structure adjustments alone do not fully explain profit performance. Overall, the findings highlight the strategic role of leverage management during economic recovery phases.
