Post-covid-leverage-profitability-nifty50

This project examines how Nifty 50 companies adjusted their capital structures in the aftermath of the COVID-19 shock and examines whether deleveraging was associated with improved earnings performance.

Using firm-level data on Debt-to-Equity ratios and net profit (₹ Cr), the analysis quantifies structural shifts in leverage between pre- and post-pandemic periods. Year-over-year profit growth is computed to evaluate operational recovery, and the relationship between leverage adjustments and profitability outcomes is assessed using correlation analysis and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression.

The findings indicate that a majority of firms reduced leverage post-COVID, reflecting balance sheet strengthening during the recovery phase. Regression results suggest a statistically significant negative relationship between leverage change and profit performance, implying that firms that deleveraged more aggressively tended to exhibit stronger earnings improvements, although explanatory power remains moderate.
