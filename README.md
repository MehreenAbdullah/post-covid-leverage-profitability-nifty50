post-covid-leverage-profitability-nifty50

This project examines how Nifty 50 companies adjusted their capital structures after the COVID-19 shock and whether post-pandemic deleveraging translated into improved profitability.

Using firm-level data on Debt-to-Equity ratios and net profit performance, the analysis measures leverage shifts, computes earnings growth, and evaluates the relationship between capital structure adjustments and profitability outcomes. The study applies correlation analysis, quadrant segmentation, and OLS regression to assess both direction and statistical significance.

Key finding: A majority of firms reduced leverage in the post-COVID period, and regression results indicate a statistically significant relationship between leverage changes and profit performance, suggesting that balance sheet strengthening played a role in recovery.
