## Post-covid-leverage-profitability-nifty50



  Tech Stack: Python
  IDE: Jupyter Notebook

Project Overview
 ---

This project examines how Nifty 50 companies changed their capital structures after the COVID-19 pandemic and whether reducing leverage actually improved profitability. Using firm-level data on Debt-to-Equity ratios and net profit (₹ Cr), it compares pre- and post-COVID periods to track shifts in leverage and year-over-year earnings recovery. The relationship between deleveraging and profitability is examined through correlation analysis and OLS regression to understand whether lower debt levels translated into stronger performance.


Structure
--
* Data cleaning and preparation of firm-level financial data
* Computation of Debt-to-Equity changes and profit growth rates
* Visualization of leverage distribution and earnings trends*
* Correlation and quadrant analysis*
* OLS regression to test statistical significance


Key Findings
---
* A majority of firms reduced leverage in the post-COVID period, indicating broad balance sheet strengthening.
* Profit growth rebounded after the pandemic shock, though performance varied across firms.
* Regression results show a statistically significant negative relationship between leverage change and profit performance.
* The explanatory power is moderate, suggesting that while de-leveraging contributed to earnings recovery, other factors also influenced profitability.


Conclusion
----
The analysis suggests that post-COVID deleveraging was not merely defensive but aligned with improved earnings outcomes. Firms that strengthened their balance sheets appear to have positioned themselves more effectively for recovery, although capital structure adjustments alone do not fully explain profit performance. Overall, the finding highlight the strategic role of leverage management during economic recovery phases.
